📈 Stock Prediction Model using TensorFlow
A deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model takes 6 feature inputs and uses LSTM and Dense layers to make predictions.

🚀 Features
📊 Uses deep learning (LSTM & Dense layers) for stock price prediction

🔢 Trained on 6 input features to analyze market trends

🎯 Optimized with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function

📈 Generates real-time predictions for stock movements

🔧 Model Architecture
python
Copy
Edit
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1], )),  # 6 features
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),  
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),  
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),  
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')  # Output layer
])
Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

📊 Usage

Train the model:

python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
Make predictions:

python
Copy
Edit
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
